# Ledder

(No documentation yet)

## Quick start

First time:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

Installing/building takes long, but after that starting will be fast:

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000

## Docker 

Just use
```
docker-compose up
```
Takes a while, since it also has to render the previews the first time.

## Development

* Cool ledder stuff is under ledder/

* Webinterface stuff is under src/ (ignore it :)
